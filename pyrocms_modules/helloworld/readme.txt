PyroCMS Helloworld module 
---------------------------- 
1. follow the file/folder structures and naming conventions.
2. Understand the module creation requirement and accordingly settings in details.xml 
3. CDATA section of the details.xml needs to carefully saved. Check your queries in database before saving them in CDATA section. 
4. Upload your module to install it.  [ remember to upload zip file ]
[helloworld.zip] or [yourmodule.zip]
5. If upload failed, delete raw upload from third_party modules folder, 
   database column if any, check your settings, check queries again, zip it, and re-upload. 
5. If still could not install it:
	--> i think you now understand the module creation flow
	--> insert few queries in database  [details.xml]
	-> add your module settings in modules table in database [details.xml]
	-> dont wait for any other documentation ;) the kickass CMS, created over the 
	    kickass framework is really easy to grasp in one shot back tracing, 2-3 hours max  
	-> hack it use it. contribute back if any.
